My believe is Science should solve the need of human and make life better.
I am a "Plant Molecular Biologist" by training therefore interested in creating smart crops 
for sustainable agriculture. I am currently working on a technology to improve 
precise genome editing for crop improvement at University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, USA
